# Eco Backend API Plan — sources

Fragments for the full plan. To **rebuild** the plan (as if it had never been built):

```bash
python cursor_scripts/build_eco_plan.py
```

Output: `.cursor/plans/eco_backend_api_plan_98338452.plan.md`

Fragments are merged in numeric order: `00_frontmatter.md`, `01_intro_decisions.md`, … `10_open.md`. Edit these files and run the script to regenerate the full plan.
